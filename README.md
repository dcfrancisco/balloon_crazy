## Work in Progress

ðŸš§ **This project is still a work in progress.** ðŸš§

We are actively working on adding new features, improving gameplay mechanics, and fixing bugs. Stay tuned for updates!

## Game Mechanics

### Objective
The main objective is to catch falling balloons by positioning the player character underneath them. You must balance on a skateboard and collect a specific number of balloons to score points and advance to the next level.

### Gameplay
1. **Movement**: 
   - Use the on-screen controls or keyboard to move your player left and right across the screen.

2. **Catching Balloons**: 
   - Balloons fall from the top of the screen in different colors and speeds:
     - **Blue balloons** fall slowly and are worth the fewest points.
     - **Green balloons** fall faster and are worth more points.
     - **Red balloons** fall the fastest and are worth the most points.
   - Position the player directly under a falling balloon to catch it on top of their head.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Points are scored based on the type of balloon caught:
     - Blue balloon = 10 points
     - Green balloon = 20 points
     - Red balloon = 30 points.
   - Points are added to your score only when a required number of balloons are caught and you pop them by pressing the fire button or a specific key.

4. **Bouncing Balloons**:
   - If you miss a balloon, you have a chance to bounce it back into the air by holding down the fire button (or space bar) and running into the balloon, allowing you to attempt catching it again.
   - This mechanic is available in some, but not all, versions of the game.

5. **Levels**:
   - Clearing all balloons from a screen lets you advance to the next level, where gameplay becomes more challenging with faster and more frequent falling balloons.
   - You gain extra players or "lives" when you reach certain score thresholds or complete levels, depending on the version.

6. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends if you lose all three players by missing balloons and falling off the skateboard.
